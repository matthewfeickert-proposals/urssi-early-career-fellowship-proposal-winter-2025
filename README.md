Please see below for additional details on how to apply.

### Fellowship

Since 2018 URSSI has been doing research, developing policy, and providing educational opportunities to improve the sustainability of scientific software in the US. Many of our efforts are purposefully focused on early-career researchers—we believe that lasting change can and should be driven by those with the most to gain. We also know (personally) that many of the exciting innovations in scientific software come from PhD students, postdocs, research software engineers, and research scientists.

With generous funding from the Sloan Foundation, we are excited to start a fellowship program for early-career researchers. Our goal is to identify and fund research projects focused on improving current disciplinary or domain practices in developing science software. In particular, we are interested in projects that address the growing use of AI in scientific software development, emerging best practices (or problems) in sustaining scientific software, and education research that might help us improve our design and delivery of software training (see more below for details).

#### Eligibility

We welcome applications from US-based early-career researchers including: PhD Students; Postdoctoral Researchers (<3 years from PhD); Research Software Engineers (0-3 years experience); and Research Scientists (0-3 years experience).

URSSI is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive scientific software community. We strongly encourage applications from individuals of all backgrounds and institutions.

#### Fellowship Benefits

We can offer financial support ranging from $10,000 to $25,000 depending on the scope of the project. Fellows will also have access to URSSI’s extensive network and resources including mentorship from senior researchers, professional development opportunities, and the opportunity to collaboration with a cohort of peer fellows.

Selected fellows will be expected to:

* Submit weekly progress reports via GitHub
* Attend bi-weekly cohort meetings
* Contribute to an URSSI newsletter
* Participate in URSSI events (remote)
* Mentor future fellows

The first cohort of URSSI Fellows will start on 1 February 2025 and end 31 July 2025, with a midpoint progress evaluation on 15 April.

#### Research Tracks

For the Winter 2025 cohort of fellows we are specifically looking for projects in one of the three following areas:

1. **AI/ML Integration in Scientific Software Development:** We are interested in supporting research or evidence-based best practices for integrating AI/ML tools in scientific software development. We welcome projects that investigate basic research questions (e.g., detecting the prevalence of AI code in science) as well as applied projects that may have the goal of informing policy or practices within a specific research domain. We are particularly interested in the integration of AI for validation, reliability, and reproducibility checks.

2. **Scientific Software Sustainability:** We would like to support researchers developing scientific software (biology, earth sciences, physics, etc.) to extend or improve practices within that domain. Example projects could include: Developing domain-specific software sustainability audits (e.g., identifying critical dependencies); creating assessment tools for research software reliability; or implementing methods for automated documentation generation (e.g., LLM assisted).

3. **Software Education Research:** URSSI runs a semi-annual school (2–3 days of co-located classroom work) to train researchers to use best practices in research software development. We would like to collaborate with education researchers to design an evaluation of these schools. This would include working closely with URSSI Winter/Spring/Fall/Summer School instructors. Projects may focus on:

* Analyzing existing software training programs
* Developing evidence-based curriculum recommendations
* Creating assessment tools for software education
* Studying learning outcomes in software workshops

#### We will not fund the following:

* Projects that are focused solely on adding new features or maintaining existing scientific software (aside from software specifically in support of research aligned with the above tracks).
* Projects that focus on literature reviews or performing surveys that are unlikely to generalize to a broad URSSI audience.

### Application

To submit an application please provide the following information, your CV, and a brief project proposal (no more than three pages) at the following link: [urssi.us/winter-2025-fellowship-application](https://urssi.us/winter-2025-fellowship-application/)

### FAQs

#### What can the budget be spent on?

Generally we are open to whatever is required to successfully complete a fellowship project. Below are the guidelines we intend to follow in all but exceptional cases:

* Travel - max $5k
* Time/salary - max $10k
* Research expenses - $10k (e.g. participant stipends, compute, etc)
* Equipment - by request only

#### Does the fellowship funding come directly to the recipient or go through an institution (potentially with overhead)?

The fellowship will come directly to the recipient, and not go through an institution. Expense reimbursements or purchases will go through URSSI’s fiscal sponsor, Code for Science & Society, and salary/stipend payments will come directly from them as an independent contractor. (Note that there are tax implications for this, that you would be responsible for handling.)

#### What is the expected time commitment?

We anticipate competitive projects will be completed in a six-month time period - the level of effort and the time commitment will vary between projects. If you intend to propose a project that will take longer than six months to complete please be in touch before your submission.

#### How many fellowships are available?

Nine total. We anticipate offering three calls for three fellows each (Winter 2025; Summer 2025; and Autumn 2025)

#### If I am not selected can I submit to a future fellowship?

Yes!

#### Can I submit multiple applications?

No, we will not consider more than one application per candidate per cycle.

#### Will you support collaborative applications?

Yes, with a few stipulations:

* Each project must have a designated lead ultimately responsible for the commitments of the proposal.
* We will not support separate applications that are codependent (e.g., results or work of one proposal depends on potential funding for another proposal).

### Do I have to live in the USA to be eligible for this fellowship?

Yes.
