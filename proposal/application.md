## Itemized Budget and Justification

1. Stipend/salary: $10000 USD

* The stipend will support my research, writing, and workshop design and organization time and effort over the course of the six (6) month Fellowship.

2. Travel: $5000 USD

* $5000 USD for travel and lodging for myself for three (3) week-long trips to the University of Wisconsin-Madison (one week for each of the workshops).
This travel funding is needed as I work remotely from UW-Madison given my research.
The amount requested is based on prices for flights to Madison, Wisconsin and lodging near the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2024.

3. Research Resources (< $10k): $10000 USD

* $4000 USD for two (2) weeks worth of Data Science Hub facilitator staff time and work integrated across the project duration.
* $1000 USD for ten (10) hours of contracted pixi developer time to provide a technical review of all course material.
* $5000 USD to provide lodging for ten (10) supported non-local participants (participants local to UW-Madison will not need travel support) to attend a two (2) day national workshop and attend a hosted workshop dinner.
The projected per participant cost ($500 USD) breakdown is:
   - $450 USD projected lodging expenses per participant in the national workshop (based on 2024 prices of affordable hotels in the University of Wisconsin-Madison area).
   Lodging would be for three (3) nights and arranged as a group hotel block reservation to minimize cost and consolidate all participant lodging into a single expense report item.
   - $50 USD expenses per participant in food for a workshop dinner at a local Madison restaurant.

A sponsorship request will be submitted to the UW-Madison Data Science Institute to cover any lodging that can not be covered from the Research Resources budget as well as support the dinner for workshop participants.
In the event of DSI sponsorship, any remaining Research Resources funds will provide support for additional non-local participants.

4. Other Direct Costs

None
* Room costs for the workshops at the DSH would be $400 USD per day but have been agreed to be waived for the workshops.

Total Requested: $25000 USD
