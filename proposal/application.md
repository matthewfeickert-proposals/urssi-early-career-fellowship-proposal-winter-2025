## Project budget

Next, please provide an itemized budget (not every category will be applicable):
1. Stipend/salary (< $10K):

2. Travel (< $5K)

3. Research Resources (< $10k):

4. Other Direct Costs

* Materials and supplies (rarely): $
* Publication costs: $
* Other (specify): $

Total Requested: $

_Please provide a brief justification for each category (2-3 sentences)._

## Itemized Budget and Justification

1. Stipend/salary: $8000 USD

* $7000 USD for three (3) weeks worth of Data Science Hub facilitator staff time and work integrated across the project duration.
* $1000 USD for ten (10) hours of pixi developer time to provide a technical review of all course material.

2. Travel: $5000 USD

* $5000 USD for travel and lodging for myself for three (3) week-long trips to the University of Wisconsin-Madison (one week for each of the workshops).
This travel funding is needed as I work remotely from UW-Madison given my research.
The amount requested is based off of prices for flights to Madison, Wisconsin and lodging near the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2024.

3. Research Resources (< $10k): $10000 USD

To provide travel and lodging stipends for twelve (12) supported non-local participants (participants local to UW-Madison will not need travel support) to attend a two (2) day national workshop is $833 USD per stipend (rounding down to the nearest dollar).
This would result in a recommended participant travel and lodging stipend maximum of:

* $383 USD travel stipend for each participant to the national workshop.
* $450 USD lodging stipend for each participant in the national workshop (based off of 2024 prices of affordable hotels in the University of Wisconsin-Madison area).

As workshop participants will have variation in their travel costs the actual amount awarded for travel will fluctuate to support the maximum number of participants.
A sponsorship request will be submitted to the UW-Madison Data Science Institute to cover any travel and lodging that can not be covered from the Research Resources budget as well as a sponsored dinner for workshop participants.

4. Other Direct Costs

None
* Room costs for the workshops at the DSH would be $400 USD per day but have been agreed to be waived for the workshops.

Total Requested: $23000 USD
